Overview
This project showcases how to build a Flutter application using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern, facilitated by GetX for state management and navigation.

MVVM is an effective architecture that allows for modular, testable and maintainable code. The GetX library simplifies working with MVVM by providing utilities for routing, dependency injection, and state management.
